# Supply-and-Demand
An economics mod for Rimworld in C# that implements diminishing return scalars for traders.

This mod is designed to create a class library for Rimworld that modifies the return of the `StockGenerator` class' `RandomCountOf` method. Currently the mod takes the natural log of the wealth on the currently visible map and uses the result to scale the random count generated by the `RandomCountOf` method.
